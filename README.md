### 🧠 Course Overview  
**Discrete Structure (SECI1013)** provides the mathematical foundation necessary for Computer Science. Unlike calculus, which deals with continuous data, this course focuses on **discrete objects** and logical structures.  
This repository serves as a personal archive for assignments, quizzes, tutorials, and notes taken throughout the semester.

#### 🧩 Topics Covered:
- Set Theory & Logic  
- Relations & Functions  
- Counting Methods and Probability  
- Graph Theory  
- Finite Automata
